/**
 * OPERATIONAL STATE PANEL (item 10) — the real, honest operational picture for the ACTIVE broker.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS, and WHY EACH IS ITS OWN SIGNAL
 *   • MARKET-DATA connection AND generation, per-instrument data readiness, last valid data times,
 *     queue/overload — the DRIVEN `market_data_state` machine, NOT the crude `feed_healthy` boolean.
 *   • ORDER-UPDATE connection and the fill-observation mechanism actually in use (stream vs REST).
 *   • Reconciliation state, entry-blocking reasons, working orders / unresolved exposure, recovery.
 *   • Effective economic admission — the five DISTINCT quantities (gross notional ≠ margin).
 *
 * THE TWO HONESTY RULES (implemented in ../lib/operationalState.ts and rendered here):
 *   1. Market-data health and order-update health are shown as SEPARATE regions. A connected quote
 *      socket (`market_data_state: READY`) is never presented as evidence that fills are observed;
 *      the anti-conflation sentence from the payload is rendered verbatim.
 *   2. A PAUSED-ENTRY state with manageable exposure is a visually DISTINCT band ("Entry paused —
 *      positions still manageable", warn tone) from a BROKEN state (error tone). The reasons entry
 *      is paused are listed explicitly so an operator can act rather than merely wait.
 *
 * Signalling is never colour-ALONE: each band carries a text glyph and a word, and status regions
 * are labelled for assistive tech (role="status"/"group", aria-label, semantic headings).
 *
 * The backend remains the sole authority; this only renders the status it publishes. An older
 * backend that omits a field shows nothing there rather than a fabricated green light.
