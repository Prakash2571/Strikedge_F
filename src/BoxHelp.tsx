/**
 * The "?" explainer for the Box page.
 *
 * Written for a TRADER, not a developer: it explains what the page is doing, what
 * every label on it means, how a box is decided, and what each parameter actually
 * changes. No code identifiers, no implementation detail that a desk analyst would
 * not care about.
 *
 * Two rules this file must keep obeying:
 *
 *  1. It describes the CURRENT configuration, not documented defaults. The live
 *     `cfg` is passed in, so every parameter below prints the value the server is
 *     really running. A hardcoded default in a help panel becomes a lie the first
 *     time someone changes an env var.
 *  2. It never claims the page shows something it does not. Several backend
 *     concepts (the paper execution PROFILE, latency calibration, the queue
 *     haircut, live-vs-paper parity) are real but are not published to this page,
 *     and they are labelled as such rather than described as if visible.

                  A <em>box</em> is four options on the same underlying and expiry, across two strikes
                  K1 &lt; K2. It settles at a fixed value — the strike width (K2 − K1) — wherever the
                  underlying ends up. So if you can put the box on for less than that width, the
                  difference is locked in.

                    <strong>Long box</strong> — buy K1 call, sell K2 call, buy K2 put, sell K1 put.
                    You <em>receive</em> the width at expiry, so you want to pay less than it.

                  <li>

                    <strong>Book freshness</strong> — each leg's order book must have been seen
                    recently enough. A depth feed only publishes when the book <em>changes</em>, so a
                    quiet strike is not a stale one; that is why the trust window is generous.

                    <strong>Depth</strong> — one whole lot must be resting at the touch on all four

                    priced, the box shows as <em>UNPRICED</em> and is never auto-traded. A box is not
                    entered on an unknown cost.

              <Section title="The entry decision">
                <p>Every candidate is priced on <em>executable</em> quotes — the ask when buying, the bid when selling, never the last traded price. The decision is one number:</p>
                <p className="box-help-formula">
                  gross edge − entry charges − estimated exit charges − expected exit slippage −
                  safety buffer = <strong>expected net profit</strong>

                  , the box is taken. Charges are the real broker heads (brokerage, STT, exchange
                  transaction, SEBI, GST, stamp duty), calculated locally and then reconciled against
                  the broker's own contract note afterwards, so a modelling error in the cost stack
                  gets caught rather than compounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <strong>safety buffer</strong> is subtracted <em>inside</em> that figure, so it
                  is part of the entry decision and raising it makes entry strictly harder. It is not
                  a stop-loss and it is not a reported-only number.

                <p className="box-help-note">
                  The re-test on filled prices is the important part. A dislocation that decays while
                  the orders are in flight is rejected — and if all four legs had already filled by
                  then, the position is reversed immediately and that cost is booked as a loss rather
                  than hidden. Those appear under <em>Aborted legging executions</em>.

                    <strong>paper touch</strong> — assumes all four legs fill instantly at the prices
                    you spotted. Optimistic; useful only as a benchmark ceiling.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>paper latency</strong> — waits a decision + order-travel delay, then fills
                    from the book that actually existed when the order would have landed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>paper legging</strong> — four <em>separate</em> orders, each arriving on
                    its own, each filling or resting or timing out independently. This is the one that
                    exposes legging risk: some legs on, others not.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>live</strong> — real broker orders through the durable order manager.

                    <strong>standard</strong> — the baseline paper behaviour: a constant latency, no
                    cancel race, no shared liquidity between concurrent attempts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>live_parity</strong> — evidence-driven. Latency, the cancel-versus-fill
                    race window and the durable-write delay are drawn from <em>measured</em> live
                    observations whenever enough recent samples exist; the four legs are scheduled
                    through the same queue, concurrency cap and broker pacing that live execution
                    uses; and displayed liquidity is finite and shared, so two concurrent attempts
                    cannot both spend the same resting lot. Every figure it produces reports whether
                    it was measured or assumed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>stress</strong> — deliberate fault injection for resilience testing. It is
                    synthetic on purpose and is a separate profile precisely so an injected fault can
                    never be mistaken for observed behaviour. It refuses to start alongside live
                    execution.

                  Under <strong>live_parity</strong> the simulator also measures its own accuracy —

                    the edge has <strong>converged</strong> — the remaining edge has shrunk to the

                    <strong>Two boxes can share an option and both be taken.</strong> Every duplicate
                    guard in the engine is keyed on the whole strike pair
                    (underlying + expiry + K1 + K2 + direction), so a box on 1300/1320 and a box on
                    1320/1340 are treated as completely unrelated even though both trade the 1320
                    strike. They can be entered in the same second, and each one assumes the
                    <em> full</em> size it saw resting at that shared strike. Nothing reserves an
                    individual contract yet.

                    <strong>What that does to these numbers.</strong> In paper it can overstate what
                    was really achievable, because the same resting lot is spent twice. The effect is
                    largest in the faster paper modes, which allow several entry pipelines at once; a
                    live run is far more serialised, because the live path admits one box at a time.
                    If you see two boxes with a common strike opened at the same timestamp, treat the
                    pair's combined fills with suspicion rather than as two independent results.

                    <strong>One market-data connection is shared.</strong> Box options and the
                    calendar-spread board are fed by a single upstream connection to the active
                    broker, drawn from one token budget. A wide Box universe therefore competes for
                    the same subscription capacity as the board, which is why the strike window is
                    capped rather than unlimited.

                  separate from the futures one. Neither exists yet, so this panel does not describe

                      Live fills are real, but the figures here are still a small sample of one
                      strategy on one venue. Read the Execution health panel — especially the failure
                      rate, <em>Partial unresolved</em> and the p95 columns — before drawing any
                      conclusion from the P&amp;L.

                      Simulated fills at observed quotes are <strong>not</strong> exchange fills.
                      Real trading additionally brings queue position, depth vanishing between
                      decision and arrival, partial fills, order rejection, and margin and position
                      limits. Treat these results as an <strong>upper bound</strong> on what the
                      strategy could have done, and read the Execution health figures before
                      believing the P&amp;L.

                  Above all: a healthy-looking day here is evidence about the <em>model</em> until it
                  has been reproduced with real orders. The system is built to report that gap rather
                  than to close it with an assumption.
