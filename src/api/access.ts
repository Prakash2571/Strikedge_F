/**
 * The site-passcode access API.
 *
 * StrikeEdge is gated by a single site passcode. Verifying it establishes an HttpOnly
 * session cookie server-side; the browser never sees, stores or forwards a SESSION token.
 * These three calls are the entire surface the AccessGate needs.
 *
 * CSRF token lifecycle lives here too: `verify` and an authenticated `status` return a
 * `csrf_token` in their JSON body; this module hands it to the in-memory store in `http.ts`
 * (`setCsrfToken`) so mutating requests can echo it in the `x-csrf-token` header. `logout`
 * clears it. NOTHING here reads or writes the session or the CSRF token in localStorage —
 * the session lives only in the cookie the backend sets and clears; the CSRF token lives
 * only in process memory.
