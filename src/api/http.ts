/**
 * The one HTTP transport for the whole StrikeEdge frontend.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES
 * ------------------
 * The CalSpread source carried a 2,623-line `api.ts` whose transport read and wrote a
 * bearer token in `localStorage` and appended it to the SSE query string. StrikeEdge's
 * session is an HttpOnly cookie the browser attaches automatically, so NONE of that
 * exists here. There is no token to read, store, log or leak — the wrapper simply sends
 * `credentials: "include"` on every request and lets the same-origin cookie do its job.
 *
 * THE FOUR THINGS THIS WRAPPER GUARANTEES
 *   1. Same-origin credentials: the session cookie rides on every call, incl. the SSE.
 *   2. Honest JSON errors: a proxy's HTML 502 no longer surfaces as a JSON parse error.
 *   3. A CSRF token header on every MUTATING request (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE). The token is
 *      held ONLY in this module's process memory — it is delivered in the JSON body of
 *      `POST /api/access/verify` (login) and of an authenticated `GET /api/access/status`
 *      (post-reload session recovery), captured via `setCsrfToken`, and echoed back in the
 *      `x-csrf-token` header. It is NEVER read from a cookie, and NEVER written to
 *      localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, a URL, a query string or a log. The backend
 *      derives its readable CSRF cookie name from a configurable `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, so
 *      reading a hardcoded cookie name here was fragile; the in-memory token is immune to
 *      that and to a custom cookie name entirely.
 *   4. A single 401 handler: any 401 notifies every subscriber exactly once so the app can
 *      tear down the SSE, drop authenticated state, clear the in-memory CSRF token and
 *      return to the gate — from one place, rather than each caller re-implementing
 *      session-expiry handling.
 */

// The CSRF request-header name is single-sourced from the vendored backend contract: it is
// generated into ./contract.generated.ts from contract/protocol.json by `npm run contract:types`.
// Importing it (rather than hardcoding the header name here) makes a backend rename propagate
// mechanically and fail CI if the frontend has not re-vendored. See the CSRF_HEADER doc below.

/**
 * Resolve the API origin from an optional configured value.
 *
 * THE SAME-ORIGIN DEFAULT
 * -----------------------
 * When NO `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is configured (the normal production case) this returns the
 * empty string, so `apiUrl("/api/box/status")` produces the RELATIVE path
 * `/api/box/status`. Production serves the SPA and the API on the SAME ORIGIN behind nginx,
 * so a relative path is correct: the browser resolves it against the page's own origin and
 * the HttpOnly session cookie rides along. This is why an absent value must NOT fall back to
 * `http://localhost:3001` — that old default made every visitor's browser call ITS OWN
 * localhost, and shipped the literal string `localhost:3001` into the public bundle.
 *
 * AN EXPLICIT VALUE IS VALIDATED, NOT TRUSTED
 * -------------------------------------------
 * If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` IS supplied it is treated as an ORIGIN ONLY (endpoints add their
 * own "/api/..." prefix). It must parse as an absolute http(s) URL. An accidental trailing
 * slash or trailing "/api" is stripped so a misconfigured value cannot produce doubled
 * "/api/api/..." URLs or a trailing-slash variant that changes cookie/CORS behaviour.
 *
 * A malformed or non-http(s) value THROWS at module load rather than silently degrading to
 * same-origin: a misconfigured API origin is a deployment error and must surface loudly, not
 * be masked by quietly talking to the wrong place.
 *
 * Exported so it can be unit-tested directly under `node:test` (which passes an explicit
 * argument) without a bundler.
 *
 * @param raw the configured value, or `undefined`/empty when none is set.
 * @returns the normalised absolute origin, or `""` for same-origin.
 * @throws if a non-empty value is not a valid absolute http/https URL.

 * cross-site form POST (which cannot set custom headers) is rejected. The backend delivers
 * it in the JSON body of `/api/access/verify` and of an authenticated `/api/access/status`,
 * and derives the name of its readable CSRF *cookie* from a configurable
 * `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`. Reading a hardcoded cookie name here broke any deployment that set
 * a custom name; holding the body-delivered token in memory is immune to that.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT persisted to localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, a URL, a
 * query string or a log — a page reload drops it, and the post-reload `/api/access/status`
 * recovery path re-seeds it from the body.
