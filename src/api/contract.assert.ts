/**
 * COMPILE-TIME CONTRACT ASSERTIONS — checked by `tsc -b` (part of `npm run build`).
 *
 * This module contains NO runtime behaviour that matters; it exists so the TypeScript
 * compiler proves, STATICALLY, that the frontend's hand-written types in `src/api/types.ts`
 * stay in lockstep with the backend-owned contract in `contract/schemas/**` (surfaced as the
 * generated types in `./contract.generated.ts`, produced by `npm run contract:types`). If the
 * backend contract and the frontend types DRIFT, `tsc -b` FAILS here — failing the build and
 * CI.
 *
 * ── ASSERTION KINDS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   MutuallyAssignable<A,B>  — A and B describe the SAME shape (each extends the other). A
 *                              field added / removed / renamed / retyped on EITHER side
 *                              breaks it. Used for shapes whose schema is fully CLOSED and
 *                              whose hand-written type matches it exactly.
 *   AssignableTo<A,B>        — every value the contract guarantees (A) is consumable by the
 *                              hand-written type (B). Used where the hand-written type is a
 *                              deliberate SUPERSET of the contract body (documented per case).
 *                              This is the consumer-critical direction: a backend rename /
 *                              removal / retype of a field the frontend reads breaks it.
 *
 * ── WHY SOME SHAPES ARE FIELD-CURATED, NOT WHOLE-OBJECT ─────────────────────────────────
 * Several Box schemas are intentionally OPEN at the leaf: engine-owned diagnostic sub-objects
 * (`box-status.scanner|monitor|charges|reconciliation|metrics|day_pnl|…`, `risk.capital`,
 * `execution.entry_burst`, …) are pinned by the schema for PRESENCE + JSON type only, so the
 * generated type is `Record<string, never>` / `unknown[]` there and cannot match the
 * frontend's richly-typed sub-objects. A whole-object assertion on those shapes would be a
 * FALSE claim. For those shapes we therefore assert MUTUAL assignability over a CURATED set of
 * the CLOSED, consumer-facing fields (scalars/enums/ids the dashboard switches on). Renaming,
 * removing or retyping any of THOSE fields on either side still breaks compilation.
 *
 * The whole exercise is inert at runtime: `export type` aliases and one `never`-typed const.

 * breaks the build. (Fields typed as bare `string` in the schema — e.g. `execution_mode`,
