/**
 * Plain-language readiness banners for the Box dashboard.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN
 * It previously read pre-computed booleans — `runtime.token_waiting`,
 * `instruments_loading`, `websocket_connecting`, `depth_ready`, `postgres_available`,
 * `live_entry_blocked`, `recovery_active`, and `exportStatus.delayed`/`lag_seconds` —
 * none of which the backend has ever sent. Every one was optional in the type, so the
 * project typechecked, built and passed its tests while EVERY banner stayed dark in
 * production. The dashboard would have looked healthy while waiting for a token.
 *
 * The backend reports FACTS (per-broker token state, feed connection, depth age,
 * `pg_ready`, `live_entry.reasons`, outbox backlog). The phrasing is this component's
 * job, so the banners are DERIVED here and each derivation is stated explicitly below.
 * Nothing is invented: where the backend cannot distinguish two situations, this says so
 * rather than guessing.
 *
 * Two states the old shape could not express are now shown:
 *   • a token-provider CONFIGURATION ERROR (passcode rejected / identity mismatch) — a
 *     fatal blocker that polling will not fix, previously indistinguishable from "waiting";
 *   • DEAD-LETTERED projections — a reporting row that gave up, previously invisible.
 *
 * And `live_entry.reasons` is now displayed, so "live entry is blocked" finally says why.
 *
 * NO SECRET IS RENDERED. `last_error` is bounded and redacted by the backend; there is no
 * token, passcode or ciphertext field in either payload.
