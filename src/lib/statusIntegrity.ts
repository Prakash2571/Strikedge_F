/**
 * STATUS INTEGRITY — the three ways a correct backend answer still gets displayed wrongly.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (SECTION 7)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Unifying the permission decision fixes WHAT the backend says. It does nothing about three
 * failure modes that live entirely on this side of the wire, each of which turns a correct answer
 * into a false display:
 *
 *   1. OUT-OF-ORDER RESPONSES. `box_status` arrives from five places on this page — the initial
 *      REST load, the opportunities fetch, the SSE snapshot flush, and the responses to the
 *      scanner and strike-level mutations. They are independent requests over one connection pool,
 *      so they can and do resolve out of order. A slow older response landing after a newer one
 *      silently rewinds the dashboard: a stale "entry permitted" can overwrite a fresh
 *      "entry blocked". `acceptDecision` refuses that using the backend's monotonic
 *      `decision_generation`.
 *
 *   2. A FAILED OR EXPIRED REFRESH THAT LEAVES STALE DATA LOOKING CURRENT. The runtime poll used
 *      `.catch(() => {})`. So when the endpoint started failing, the last good snapshot simply
 *      stayed on screen — indistinguishable from a healthy system, for as long as the failure
 *      lasted. `RefreshTracker` makes the age and the failure explicit so the UI can go
 *      stale/unknown rather than confidently wrong.
 *
 *   3. DOUBLE-SUBMITTED MUTATIONS. Guards written as `disabled={busy !== null}` read `busy` from
 *      the render closure. React state updates are asynchronous, so two clicks in the same frame
 *      BOTH observe the pre-update value and BOTH fire the request. `ControlRequests` tracks
 *      in-flight requests in a ref-friendly, SYNCHRONOUS map, so the second click is refused
 *      before it reaches the network.
 *
 * PURE: no React, no fetch, no globals, no clock except an injected `now`. That is what lets the
 * component logic be tested directly under `node:test` (this project's harness cannot render TSX),
 * and it is the SAME code the components run — not a parallel copy.

/**
 * Should an incoming readiness decision be APPLIED, or IGNORED as out-of-order?
 *
 * The rule is strict monotonicity on the backend's own `decision_generation`, which the backend
 * increments once per decision. Equal is also refused: re-applying the same generation cannot add
 * information, and treating it as new would reset any "this is fresh" timer built on top.
 *
 * Wall-clock timestamps are deliberately NOT used for this. `decided_at` comes from the server, the
 * comparison would be against a client clock, and a client whose clock is a few seconds off would
 * either accept every stale response or reject every fresh one. A monotonic counter minted by the
 * one authority that orders these decisions has neither problem.

 *   live_order_management   the live order path (modify/chase/cancel authority)
 *   emergency               emergency flatten — never queued behind another control
 *   session_arming          arming/disarming the supervised trading SESSION and its budget
 *   scanner                 starting/stopping the opportunity scanner
 *   mode                    execution-mode / paper-profile changes
