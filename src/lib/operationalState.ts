/**
 * OPERATIONAL-STATE DERIVATION — the pure half of the operational dashboard (item 10).
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE PURE MODULE
 * The frontend test harness is `node:test` importing modules directly (no DOM, no JSX render).
 * So every non-trivial decision the operational panel makes — which health BAND a transport is
 * in, whether the two independent health signals may be shown together, why entry is paused,
 * whether existing positions remain manageable — lives here as a pure function and is unit-tested,
 * including the degraded/reconnecting cases. The component (`BoxOperationalState.tsx`) only maps
 * these results onto markup.
 *
 * THE TWO HONESTY RULES THIS MODULE ENCODES
 *   1. Market-data health and order-update health are INDEPENDENT facts. `deriveMarketData` and
 *      `deriveOrderStream` never read each other; a connected quote socket can be READY while the
 *      order stream is REST-polling, and vice-versa. Neither is allowed to imply the other.
 *   2. During reconnection, a PAUSED-ENTRY state with manageable exposure (`band: "paused"`) is a
 *      distinct band from a BROKEN state (`band: "broken"`). `entryPausedReasons` states exactly
 *      WHY entry is paused; `positionsManageable` states whether existing positions can still be
 *      managed (exit/cancel), so "paused but safe" never renders like "broken".
 *
 * GROSS NOTIONAL vs MARGIN: `economicFigureLabel` carries each of the five economic quantities
 * under its OWN label; this module never sums or relabels one as another.
 *
 * PURE: no browser globals, no fetch, no clock except an injected `now` where an age is computed.

 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DEFECT (b): THIS FUNCTION USED TO BE A SECOND PERMISSION MATRIX
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It decided `entryPermitted` from exactly two things: whether market data was READY, and whether
 * the order stream owed a reconciliation. That missed nearly every real blocker — a stopped scanner,
 * a disarmed entry control, an unready token, unavailable PostgreSQL, pending migrations, an active
 * recovery pass, unreconciled orders, a spent session budget — and it missed a DEGRADED order-stream
 * lifecycle entirely. Pre-fix, with the backend refusing entry and the order stream DEGRADED, this
 * returned `entryPermitted: true`, `overallBand: "ready"`, `entryPausedReasons: []`, and the panel
 * rendered a green "New entry is permitted".
 *
 * Two independent permission matrices cannot be kept in agreement; the only fix is to have one. The
 * backend now publishes a single authoritative decision (`box_status.operational_readiness`, built by
 * the SAME permission table its live-entry checkpoint enforces), and this function RENDERS it.
 *
 * WHAT REMAINS LOCAL, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SECOND MATRIX
 * The two transport BANDS (`md.band`, `os.band`) are still computed here, because they are
 * PRESENTATION — which colour and glyph a transport region gets. They no longer decide any
 * permission. The verdict, the reasons and the manageability answer all come from `decision`.
 *
 * A MISSING DECISION IS "UNKNOWN", NEVER GREEN
 * If `decision` is absent (an older backend, or a status that has not loaded), the gate reports the
 * `unknown` band with entry NOT permitted. Degrading to a green light on missing evidence is the
 * exact failure this whole section exists to remove.
