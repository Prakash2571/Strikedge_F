/**
 * A reconnecting EventSource for the Box stream.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * A bare `new EventSource(url)` reconnects on its own, but with no ceiling on the browser's
 * retry cadence and, crucially, NO way to stop after an auth failure — it would hammer a
 * 401ing endpoint forever. StrikeEdge needs the opposite of that on a 401: close, notify,
 * and stay closed until the user re-authenticates.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT
 *   • Opens with `withCredentials: true` — the SSE authenticates with the same-origin
 *     HttpOnly session cookie, NOT a token in the query string.
 *   • On a TRANSIENT error it reconnects with exponential backoff CAPPED at a ceiling.
 *   • On a 401 it does NOT reconnect: it closes, calls `onUnauthorized`, and stops. The 401
 *     is detected out-of-band (a real EventSource error event carries no status code), so
 *     the caller supplies `probeUnauthorized` — a cheap authenticated GET that resolves true
 *     when the session is gone. This keeps the "is this a network blip or a dead session?"
 *     decision in one place.
 *
 * The class is intentionally free of React so its reconnect/backoff logic is unit-testable
 * under node:test with a fake EventSource.
