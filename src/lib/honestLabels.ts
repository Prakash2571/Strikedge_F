/**
 * HONEST LABELLING — the wording that must change when the system's mode does.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT INLINE STRINGS (SECTION 7)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three of the display defects in this section are one defect: a sentence hardcoded at a point where
 * the system's actual mode was not consulted.
 *
 *   • "Box arbitrage · paper trading, one lot" sat in the page header as a literal. Under
 *     BOX_EXECUTION_MODE=live it kept saying "paper trading" — the single most dangerous label a
 *     trading UI can get wrong, because it invites an operator to press a button they would not
 *     press if it said LIVE.
 *   • Scanner STOP said "no new boxes will be opened" but not, unambiguously, whether existing
 *     positions were still being watched. The difference between "stopped scanning" and "stopped
 *     caring about my open box" is the difference between a routine pause and an emergency.
 *   • An UNKNOWN P&L rendered through a numeric formatter becomes ₹0 — a specific, false claim of
 *     break-even, made at exactly the moment the system does not know.
 *
 * Putting the wording in pure functions means the mode is a required ARGUMENT: a label cannot be
 * produced without stating which mode it describes, so this class of defect cannot be reintroduced
 * by forgetting a conditional. Every function here is pure and directly unit-tested.
