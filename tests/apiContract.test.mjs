/**
 * API CONTRACT TEST — the frontend's types must match what the backend actually sends.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The frontend and backend were built separately, and the types for the new StrikeEdge
 * endpoints drifted badly without anything noticing:
 *
 *   GET /api/runtime/status  — the frontend declared `token_waiting`, `instruments_loading`,
 *     `websocket_connecting`, `depth_ready`, `postgres_available`, `live_entry_blocked`,
 *     `recovery_active`, `detail`. The backend sends `brokers[]`, `active_broker`,
 *     `pg_ready`, `migration_state`, `recovery_ready`, `live_entry{blocked,reasons}`,
 *     `recovery_pending`, `residual_exposure`. Exactly ONE name overlapped.
 *
 *   GET /api/export/status  — frontend declared `delayed`, `lag_seconds`, `last_export_at`,
 *     `detail`; backend sends `connected`, `backlog_count`, `oldest_pending_age_ms`,
 *     `last_success_at`, `last_error`, `dead_letter_count`. One name overlapped.
 *
 *   GET /api/broker/status  — frontend declared a SINGLE broker with `dhan_configured`,
 *     `dhan_instruments`, `feed`, `last_margin_source`; the backend returns
 *     `{active_broker, generation, brokers[]}` and has no margin-source field at all.
 *
 * Every drifted field was optional or was read off a cast `fetch` result, so TypeScript
 * could not see it: the app typechecked, built, and passed its tests while every readiness
 * banner stayed dark and the broker panel rendered `undefined`. A green build proved
 * nothing about the contract.
 *
 * HOW THIS TEST WORKS
 * The AUTHORITY for response shapes is now the backend-owned, vendored JSON-Schema contract in
 * `contract/schemas/**` (pinned by `contract/BACKEND_CONTRACT.json`, digest-verified by
 * `npm run contract:verify`, and validated against these fixtures in
 * `tests/contractSchemas.test.mjs`). The JSON in `tests/fixtures/` is NO LONGER the contract —
 * it is a set of realistic sample payloads CAPTURED FROM A RUNNING StrikeEdge BACKEND (see
 * tests/fixtures/README.md).
 *
 * The assertions BELOW are retained as a COMPLEMENTARY, human-readable check of the specific
 * fields the UI reads (the banners, the broker panel, the safety defaults) — they document
 * intent at the call site in a way a schema does not. They do not replace the schema authority;
 * they sit alongside it. The static type↔contract gate lives in `src/api/contract.assert.ts`
 * (checked by `tsc -b`), and the digest/pin gate in `contract/verify.mjs`.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO: a fixture is a recording, so it goes stale if the backend changes and
 * nobody re-captures. That is precisely why the SCHEMAS (not these fixtures) are the authority
 * now — a schema is validated against the backend's REAL serialized responses in the backend's
 * own contract suite, so it cannot quietly lie about the API.
